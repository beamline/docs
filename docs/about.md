      abstract = {Beamline is a software library to support the research and development of streaming process mining algorithms. Specifically, it comprises a Java library, built on top of Apache Flink, which fosters high performance and deployment. The second component is a Python library (called pyBeamline, built using ReactiveX) which allows the quick prototyping and development of new streaming process mining algorithms. The two libraries share the same underlying data structures (BEvent) as well as the same fundamental principles, thus making the prototypes (built by researchers using pyBeamline) quickly transferrable to full-fledged and highly scalable applications (using Java Beamline).}
